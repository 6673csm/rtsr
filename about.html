                Emergency Response Management (ERM) is helpful in supporting emergency response operations across
                organizational, jurisdictional, and geographical boundaries. The US government recognized the growing
                importance
                of ERM in countering both natural and manmade hazards, and established a National Incident Management
                System
                (NIMS) at federal level. The NIMS prescribes institutional response guidelines that help in establishing
                rule
                structures and developing a normative environment with defined tasks should be done for response.
                <br>
                <br>
                The coordination of emergency response is difficult as it involves factoring in exigencies typical of an
                emergency
                situation of uncertainty, high time pressure, shortage of resources. It is also affected by large scale
                impact
                and damage, and the disruption of infrastructure support, which is necessary for coordination like
                electricity,
                telecommunications, and transportation.
                <br>

                Emergency management includes (1) planning for possible emergencies, (2) providing resources to execute
                the
                plan, (3) practicing and continuously improving the plan, (4) training or informing employees,
                contractors,
                neighbors, and local authorities on what to do, how they will be notified, and how to report an
                emergency,
                and
                (5) effectively communicating with stakeholders in the event an incident does occur.
                The scope of the the emergency element extends well beyond “putting out the fire.” This chapter focuses
                on
                three
                aspects of emergency planning and response:

                Protecting people, including people who are onsite, offsite, and emergency responders.
                Responding to catastrophic accidents involving explosions, large releases of chemicals, or other
                largereleases
                of energy.
