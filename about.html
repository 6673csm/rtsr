    <p>
        Emergency Response Management (ERM) is helpful in supporting emergency response operations across
        organizational, jurisdictional, and geographical boundaries. The US government recognized the growing importance
        of ERM in countering both natural and manmade hazards, and established a National Incident Management System
        (NIMS) at federal level. The NIMS prescribes institutional response guidelines that help in establishing rule
        structures and developing a normative environment with defined tasks should be done for response.

        The coordination of emergency response is difficult as it involves factoring in exigencies typical of an
        emergency
        situation of uncertainty, high time pressure, shortage of resources. It is also affected by large scale impact
        and damage, and the disruption of infrastructure support, which is necessary for coordination like electricity,
        telecommunications, and transportation.
        <br>
        <br>
        Emergency management includes (1) planning for possible emergencies, (2) providing resources to execute the
        plan, (3) practicing and continuously improving the plan, (4) training or informing employees, contractors,
        neighbors, and local authorities on what to do, how they will be notified, and how to report an emergency, and
        (5) effectively communicating with stakeholders in the event an incident does occur.
        The scope of the the emergency element extends well beyond “putting out the fire.” This chapter focuses on three
        aspects of emergency planning and response:

        Protecting people, including people who are onsite, offsite, and emergency responders.
        Responding to catastrophic accidents involving explosions, large releases of chemicals, or other largereleases
        of energy.
